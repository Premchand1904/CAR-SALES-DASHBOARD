1. CC vs Power:
This chart seems to show a comparison between engine displacement (in cubic centimeters, or CC) and engine power.
Different fuel types such as Petrol, Diesel, LPG, and CNG are represented by different colors.
The plot indicates that higher engine displacement generally corresponds to higher power, though there are variations across different fuel types.

2. KM vs Number of Owners:
This chart compares the distance driven (in kilometers) with the number of owners for various car brands.
It seems that as the number of owners increases, the distance driven also tends to increase. However, there is a significant variance among different brands.
For example, the tooltip shows that for the Maruti brand, a car with 1 owner has driven about 79,325,605 kilometers, which is an unusually high number, suggesting this could be an outlier or data entry error.

3. Average Selling Prices by Years:
This bar graph illustrates the average selling price of cars over different years.
The selling prices have fluctuated over the years, with noticeable spikes around 2020 and 2021.
Different brands are represented, with colors corresponding to each brand. Most brands seem to follow similar trends in price changes over time.
The significant spike in 2020-2021 might indicate an abnormal market event (e.g., economic factors, demand surge, or other conditions impacting prices).
